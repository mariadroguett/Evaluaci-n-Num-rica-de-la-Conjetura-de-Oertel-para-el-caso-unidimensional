1.In order to run singularity you need to create in your terminal (or in the same slurm script) the
logs folder. In this specific case, on your run_slurm_sing.sh the log folder is named as logs_merqury, 
so, in your working folder you type:

===================================================================================================
mkdir logs_merqury
===================================================================================================

2.Then you can run your run_slurm_script.sh as:
===================================================================================================
sbatch run_slurm_sing.sh
===================================================================================================

3.You can check if slurm is running your job with squeue command (type it in your terminal)

4.If you want to see how is your script working, you can enter to de logs_merqury folder
=========================================
cd logs_merqurt_folder
=========================================

and do:
==============================================
less/tail/cat  optim_sing.out /optmis_sing.err
==============================================
(Choose just one command to explore the file)
